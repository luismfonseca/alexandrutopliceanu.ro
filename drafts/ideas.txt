1. What do you do when you write a lib that works on node/browser/amd but depends on libs that also work both on node/browser/amd
	- how do you manage dependencies ??
	- of course this has been done! https://gist.github.com/1262861

2. easy install nodejs on windows, kinda !

3. testing js frameworks overview - there's a lot of them

4. overview of methods to get rid of spagetti code: futures, promises, defered, my impl, etc.
	-solutions: mine, fab.js, step.js, continuations, promises, jquery deffered, stela's blog post etc...
